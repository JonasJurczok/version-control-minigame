# Version Control Minigame
A social game to teach version control.

This game is intended to be used to teach non developers the usage and purpose of version control. As synchronizing work between multiple people/teams is a global problem this is important knowledge in any line of knowledge work.

## Setup

To run this game take the material from the [material](#material) section.

* Prepare the [source text](#source-text) as a larger poster or on a whiteboard.
* Prepare one copy fo the source text for every participant.
* Prepare every task from the [task list](#Tasks) as a separate card.

## Running the game

To do the game get the group together and tell them that the goal is to experience work as a software engineer.
They should imagine that the [source text](#source-text) is a piece of software. Specifically this means that syntax and
semantics matter (as in the text makes sense). The goal for the group is to get all tasks done in the allotted
time frame.

In the first iteration let the group work on their own. Just give them the cards, start the clock (~5 minutes)
and watch. The assumption is that after one or two minutes the source text transforms into utter chaos as
the conflicting tasks introduce confusion.

As soon as there is enough confusion and you can see that the group will not be able to finish the task stop them.
Get them to recap on the problems they had with a special focus on coordination.

Next explain how branches (everyone has their own copy) and mergin (only one merge at a time) work.
After this hand out the "branch cards" and let the group start again. The assumption is that the conflicts
will be more visible and structured and there should be questions about what to do first/next. At this point
you can explain the role of the functional lead/product owner as the organizing factor in this situation.

If everything works out and the merges are done in the right order you should receive the [target text](#target-text) as a result.

## Material

### Source text

````
1   """
2   This is a program designed to teach the basics of  Version Control and Source Code management.
3   """
4
5   The problem of working with
6   multiple people on the same
7   Source Code base is that during
8   development you have to carefully
9   allign all the changes.
10
11  Otherwise you end up with a huge mess
12  and noone can read your code anymore
13  and also it is not doing what it is supposed to do...
